# react-skeleton-loading

> A react library for generating custom skeleton loading components automatically

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-skeleton-loading.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-skeleton-loading) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install skeleton-loading-react
```

## Basic Usage 

Just pass the component you want to load as a children to the Skeleton component. 
If the children is receiving any props, you should also pass an `exampleProps` prop, which is an object with the same props that your component receives, 
that will be used to determine, for example, the length of the texts.

Here is a basic example: 
```
import {Skeleton} from 'skeleton-loading-react'

import {UserCard} from '../Components/UserCard'

//This mimics a delay from the api
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
useEffect(()=>{
  setTimeout(()=>{
    setIsLoading(false)
  },2000)
},[])

//imagine this data is coming from an api
const user = {
  name: 'Filipe Pfluck',
  avatar: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62773200?v=4',
  description: 'Fullstack developer focused in typescript.'
}

//Now let's create an example user:
const fakeUser = {
  name: 'Joe Doe',
  avatar: 'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/10/05/22/37/blank-profile-picture-973460__340.png',
  description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.'
}

...

return(
  <Skeleton
    isLoading={isLoading}
    exampleProps={{user: fakeUser}}
  >
    <UserCard user={user}/>
  </Skeleton>
)
```

## Documentation 

The skeleton component accepts the following props: 
- isLoading: boolean
- exampleProps: any object (should have the same props that your component receives)
- defaultStyles: CSSProperties (those will be added to every element considered as content, in other words, the ones that have a background)
- className: string (will be added to the same elements as above)

## Considerations

If you want to change the background, it is done through the background-image property.
This is the default background: 
```
background-image: linear-gradient(
    -90deg,
    #28262E 0%,
    #605e67 50%,
    #28262E 100%
);
background-size: 400% 400%;
```
You can change it passing `defaultStyles`, `className`, or even styling it other way, such as using styled-components
